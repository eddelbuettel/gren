#' 772 sequenced microRNAs in cervical cancer.
#'
#' A dataset containing 772 sequenced microRNA for 32 healthy women and 24 
#' women with pre-cursor lesions for cervical cancer. Additionally, 
#' the conservation levels of the microRNAs are given, coded in three levels:
#' "NotCons", "Mammals", "Broadly", that correspond to microRNAs only found in 
#' humans, found in most mammals, and found in most vertebrates, respectively.
