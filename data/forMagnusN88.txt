forMagnusN88.Rdata contains 6 objects:
- datfr is a data.frame of 88 observations with 4 clinical covariates: a binary 
  factor adjth with prior use of adjuvant therapy (binary), a ternary factor 
  thscheme with the type of systemic treatment regimen, an integer age, and   
  binary factor pcrcdiff with primary tumor differentiation.
- mirnormcen_resp is a data.frame of 88 observations of 2114 micrornas 
  (pre-processed).
- TumMirs is a data.frame of 222 observations that contains several statistics
  calculated on a set of micrornas that were selected for further investigation.
- resp is a binary factor that contains the target of classification: "Progr"
  and "TherBenefit", which indicates whether a patient benefited from treatment
  or progressed in disease.
- whichin is a integer of length 2114 that is NA if the microRNA was not 
  selected and an integer otherwise.
- partkeep is a list of length 4 with different partitions of the microRNAs, 
  based on abundance, standard deviations, selection of microRNAs that were 
  expressed differently (FDR <= 0.05) in two comparisons: metastatatic tissue
  versus normal non-colorectal tissue and primary tumour versus primary normal
  colorectal tissue, and a partition based on FDRS.
