NwkDegreePartition.Rdata contains two objects:
- NetworkDegreeClass is a matrix with (per metabolite) the degree and the 
  assigned partitionclass (ordened as the original data object in 
  ESetMbolCSFPR2.Rdata)
- NetworkDegreeClassOrder is like NetworkDegreeClass, but ordened witg degree

The objects are based on the differential network, where the connections denote
differences between the AD and control groups. A metabolite with a high degree
in this network has a different function in the AD APOE E4 and APOE no E4 
groups. This metabolite weighs more in differentiating between the two groups.

A partitionclass of 1 denotes metabolites with degree 0, 2 denotes metabolites
with positive degree smaller than the average degree (calculated on the 
connected nodes), and 3 denotes metabolites with degree larger than average.
