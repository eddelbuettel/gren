Introduction
	- Optionally add references to suggestions by first reviewer

Simulations
	- Add latent group lasso (multiple partitions), grpregOverlap package
	- Investigate: plot predicted probabilities, characteristics of selected features
	- choose two fixed number of selected features and compare the methods
	- remove GRridge with selection (leave without selection in)
	- move full scenario descriptions to supplement
	- auc and brier in manuscript, rest of performance measures in supplement

Data
	- check alzheimer proteomics met platform groepen en selectie van e4yes
	- Find data with less user input (no preliminary experiment), options: 
		metabolomics array, alzheimer, quality control
		sequenced microRNAs, colorectal cancer, previous study
		sequenced microRNAs, cervical pre-cancer, conservation status
		methylation array, cervical pre-cancer, CpG island annotation
		Arcene cancer data (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arcene)
	- Investigate: predicted probabilities, characteristics of selected feature
	- emphasise stability selection

Discussion
	- Reiterate the minimal input of the user and added value of new method
	- possibly remove group lasso part (already in introduction)
	- Give timings of the method, compared to other methods
	- remove double EM part




editor:
Dear Dr. van de Wiel,

I appreciate you reaching out to us with your request. It is indeed important to us at Biostatistics that we provide you appropriate and timely feedback on your work. 

I agree that the referee reports are short but they are extremely consistent with both reviewers clearly stating that you have not sufficiently demonstrated the unique practical advance over the large amount of literature existing in the area. As you point out, you have mentioned some differences in the discussion and provided a simulation study comparing a small number of approaches. 

I would be willing to consider a revision of your work if you made a substantial effort to rework the simulation examples and practical case studies to demonstrate clearly unique cases where your method works and others don't (as well as the reverse case!). This comparison should include, not just the EN and Grouped Lasso, but other methods that approach this same problem as well. There would need to be clear empirical demonstration on real data of a unique advantage of this approach for it to be a good fit at Biostatistics. 

I recognize that that is a major request and therefore will understand if you are not interested in pursuing publication at Biostatistics given the uncertainty that would go with such a revision. If you do undertake a revision please do let us know when it is submitted so that I can handle it again as co-editor.

 Regardless I wish you the best of luck with the paper. 

Best

Jeff Leek

Comments to the Author
In this paper the authors have developed a Empirical Bayes Elastic net model, where the elastic net penalty are assigned on predetermined separate groups. The paper is written in full details. However, in my opinion the scientific contribution and novelty of the methodology is just incremental. Elastic net itself is designed to do the grouping. So, I am not sure why putting group penalty elastic net will be better than other group penalty methods like group lasso. Also Bayesian logistic regression can be formulated based on Polya-Gamma latent variables (Polson et al.)  and that need to be incorporated in your modeling strategy. Why no comparison between the proposed method and at least the group lasso which assigns the group penalty. The model contains several tuning/prior parameters. Sensitivity analysis need to be provided for that. How much your model is scalable? EM is notoriously slow. The authors have also missed several relevant references and should put some more focus on the literature review.

Reviewer 2
General comments 
This paper considered a group-regularized (logistic) elastic net regression method. The method uses the Bayesian formulation of logistic elastic net regression to estimate both the model and penalty parameters in an approximate empirical-variational Bayes framework. Simulation studies are conducted and a real data analysis is made for illustration. 
The paper is interesting and has certain merits but I have some concerns as follows. 
Specific comments 
1. The elastic net including a penalty term of the L1 and L2-norm of regression coefficients is well defined in the literature and was also applied to logistic regression models. This paper considered the use of group elastic net method. Compared to Meier et al (2008, JRSS B) who used group lasso penalty, you proposed to use the group elastic net. This extension is fine, but the novelty is rather little in this sense. 
2. In (2.2), the penalization parameters λ1 , λ2 and λg appears in the forms of λ1 sqrt􏰟(λg′) and 
λ2λ′g. A question is, is there is an identifiability issue here? If not, why not? 
3. The computational load and time: As commented in the Discussion, the proposed method uses the double EM loop, which not only increases the chance of ending up in a local optimum but also can be very time consuming in computation. It would be helpful by commenting on the computation time, for example, in the real data analysis.
